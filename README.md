# Digital-Diary
This is my FYP project.
The Digital Diary is a web-based platform aimed at improving communication and academic management in schools. The platform focuses on homework tracking, grade management, attendance monitoring, and facilitating communication between students, teachers, and parents. The project also integrates AI features to provide career path suggestions based on academic performance, offering a personalized experience for students. The proposed solution ultimately aims to create a collaborative and efficient educational environment.
